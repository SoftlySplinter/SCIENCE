# Smart Vunerabilities

*Martyn Thomas CBE FREng*

## Smart Buildings

Offer significant benefits **and new vulnerabilities**.

### Benefits

* Access Passes, Attendance monitoring, follow me printing
* Calendar, room booking, etc.
* CCTV, WiFi, Remote and central monitoring and control
* Dynamic displays, emergency messages, fire alarms

### Vulnerabilities

* Denial of access, unauthorised access, data compromise
* Disruption, wasted energy, damage
* Intrusion, loss of control,
* Safety.

## Smart Cars

Michael Barr's expert report in the Bookout v Toyota lawsuit.  [See here](http://www.safetyresearch.net/Library/BarrSlides_FINAL_SCRUBBED.pdf).

## Safety World

Safety world works on probabilities, but in security there is a direct attacker - can't argue independence.

## Smart Meter Security

End-to-end security: "No trusted components".

Whether this works or not is unknown.

### Vulnerabilities

* Meters contain clocks and billing data, if these are changed, bills can be manipulated.
* Meters contain an off switch, misuse could cause distress, harm or substantial disruption.
* Meter firmware will need to be updated.
* The Gas meter can only handle low-grade encryption.

#### Who controls the off switch?

Anyone who has the authority to send the relevant messaged through the DCC.

Anyone who can mount a successful **cyber attack** on the network.

#### How will security be assured?

* Human review of the spec.s
* Testing the system
* Focuesed pentesting

Testing only shows that faults **do** exist, not that there are no faults.

For high confidence you need formal methods.

## Cyber Security

Is a through-life discipline.

* Planning
* Control
* Monitoring
* Response



* From design through to decommissioning
* Lifetimes of 20+ years
* Don't run anti-virus
* Monitoring is difficult (and uncommon)
* How to respond to incidents?
* Insider threats
* Lifetime security needs discipline and excellent configuration control through years of maintenance and upgrades.

## Cyber Security

Is a tier one threat.
