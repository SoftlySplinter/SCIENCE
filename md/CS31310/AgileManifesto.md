# Agile Manifesto #

> The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, is stated below.
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and
> helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>
> * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
> * Working software over comprehensive documentation.
> * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
> * Responding to change over following a plan.
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
> on the left more. (Source: agilemanifesto.org)
> For each of these values, discuss why the words in bold print are valued
> more than the words in light print.
> [16 Marks]

*I reckon 16 marks means 4 marks per point. Each point has two sides to it so 2 points per side*

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Whilst it is important to use the right processes and tools in software
development to help your team work effectively together, facilitating
direct interaction of individuals often allows much more effective
communication of ideas and problems. For example, if developers are encouraged
to use a bug tracker rather than approach each other directly, then serious
problems may be temporarily overlooked and placed on a virtual backlog
instead and not getting resolved. If developers interact and discuss issues
then real progress can be made to resolve them rather than ignoring them for a
few more iterations.

> Working software over comprehensive documentation

The traditional waterfall model (W Royce, 1970) focuses very heavily on
comprehensive documentation and making sure that all aspects of the software
have been designed and written up before any programming happens. In agile, it
is better to have software that works even if the documentation isn't fully
functional since clients can't deploy and run documents.
