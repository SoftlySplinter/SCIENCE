SE33010 - Formal Methods in Software Engineering
================================================

Fred Long (fwl). 

The use of mathematical formal methods in software specification and techniques for producing reliable software.

**Reminder:** Fred has a good lecturing style :)

You will need to put effort in to succeed. Not all mathematics (but there is a fair amount).

Why do we need formal methods?
------------------------------

Bugs are common in software.

Legal requirement to report vulnerabilities (vulnerabilities are a special class of bug).

> "If debugging is the process of taking out bugs, programming must be the process of putting them in."

Cannot prove the absence of bugs by testing software. Need to be able to prove there are no bugs in the software $\rightarrow$ prove the software is correct. Mathematical techniques can begin to do this.

Few example of where this has been done successfully:

* Metro lines in Paris (14) Oct. 1998 has an automatic train control system was developed on time, in budget and was proved to be 100% correct using formal proof.
* A real time air-traffic control system used VDM, developed for London airports. Productivity of developers: 13 lines per person per day compared to 7. Wasn't proved to be correct - 35% reduction in defects. Industry standard: 1 defect per 1000 lines of code.
* BMW/Rolls Royce test facility used Z notation for certification testing of the electronic control system.
* NASA international space system fault detection system, irregularities discovered early in development using formal methods.
* IEEE reporting on experience from a student group project. Two classes of groups of students, one using formal development, one using traditional development (small groups, 2 students per group). 45.5% of traditional groups passed testing, 100% of formal groups passed testing.
