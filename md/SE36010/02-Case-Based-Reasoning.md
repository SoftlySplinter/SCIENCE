# Case Based Reasoning

* Based on case law - made up of thousands of precedent cases
* Totally different from diagnostic fault tree and rule based system

* Works well for a broad but shallow domain: works well for a forest of trees
* Different kinds of expertise
* Based on experience rather than theory - important

# Case Based Reasoning and 4R cycle

* Retrieve
* Reuse & Revise
* Retain

Using Euclidean distance to calculate similarity between cases. Each feature is assigned a weighting.

* Consider all the bulletpoints from the presentation in the assignment
* Consider storing cases with indexes for easy retrieval.

# Ranking

* If multiple cases match, rank by similarity
* Consider time and cost of operations
