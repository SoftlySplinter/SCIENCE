Commercial Organisations
------------------------


* Sole Trader
    * Local Shop, Plumber, etc.
* Partnership
    * Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants
* Limited Company
    * Public and private


Sole Traders
------------

An individual who is responsible for all debts. All assets including "private" at risk; if you have debts the business can't pay then you may lose personal items (including houses, etc.).

Can register for VAT, has to register for inland revenue/social security. Income tax on profits, national in-sewer-ants.

$$Profits = Sales - Costs$$

Simplified bookkeeping.

Does **not** have to be the only employee.

Lots of risks. Lots of independence and flexibility.


Partnerships
------------

Similar to sole trader but with two or more owners.

Normally professionals.

(*Rhys mentioned stuff about Limited Liability Partnerships which might be useful for the assignment.*)


Incorporated
------------

Law recognises individuals are responsible for actions (except by your, mental incapacity or registered student), can enter into contracts and can be sued, tried for crimes, etc.

Act of parliament imposes duties on the individual.

Incorporation; making a body (*Corpus*)

Make a company look like a person (a body).

* Royal Charters
* Acts of Parliament
* Public and Private Companies


Share Capital
-------------

Shareholders (Subscribers) own the company. Managing Directors may not be shareholders. Ever limited company has to have at least one annual meeting with the shareholders.

At the start of the company you authorise the share capital (the number of shares and their nominal (par) value). You can set the company up with shares at £0.01 per share (100 shares for £1). All the shareholders lose is the initial investment; directors may be liable for bankruptcy. This stops "Phoenix Companies". A company may go bankrupt for no fault of it's own (e.g. due to recession).

In the United Kingdom, there seems to be a "looking down" on someone who has failed at a business, unlike in the USA and Germany.

Shares can be paid for (the shareholder's equity). This equity is put into the bank for the company. As a shareholder you can partly pay for these shares but if the company demands the full value of the shares you must pay it.

Preference shares are slightly different in that if you started a company. These shares take a set value of the profits before the rest of the shareholders.

When a company is "wound up" (going into liquidation, either voluntary or forced) all debts must be paid before the shareholders. All assets are sold. If there is a remainder then this remainder is divided equally between shareholders. If the debts are greater than the assets, the shareholders lose shares.

Quite often the owners buy the assets so the money goes back to the shareholders.

**Rhys' tip of the day:** if you need money go to friendly solicitor and threaten them with winding up procedures.

When a company goes public all shares are sold at a set price. The company then owns some of their own shares. Individuals will then buy shares because people want to buy shares, or because they will get some of the profit in the form of a dividend. The effect this has in the open market is that if you look at the initial price is the nominal value of the company. It's just that people are trading these shares as if they were selling tickets for an event. There's a slight difference in that most big companies will have shares in themselves so they can borrow money against their shares.

If you have a good share price, you become very attractive to banks.


Bureaucracy
-----------

Large Companies (Public Limited Company [PLC]), shares are available to the public via the stock exchange.

Small companies cannot advertise shares in the same way. Regulated by Companies Act.

(*Some table on what a micro, small and medium company is*)


Company Constitution
--------------------

When you start a company you have to go and buy it.

In the UK it is easy to start and run a limited company.

> *"I hate to say this but some of my best friends are French."* Rhys Parry, February 2013



There is a Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association and there can be Shareholders Agreement.


###Memorandum of Association

* Restrictions on company name.
* Register for a specific country.
* The objects of company (Companies Act 1989 allow general commercial company).
* A liability clause (liability of members is limited).
* Authorised Share value.


###Articles of Association

* Rules of Share capital
* Transfer of Shares
* Meetings of Members
* Rules governing directors' appointments
* Power of directors
* Dividends and reserves

Changed in a shareholders meeting.

Dividends are the money which the directors decided (under the guidance of the shareholders) which is given away to the shareholders. Reserves help take the company into the next year.


###Shareholders Agreement

* Protect interests of minor shareholders
* Article of Associated can only be changed at a general meeting and needs a 75% majority (look this up, it may have changed).
* Agreement between shareholders, all shareholders must sign and can govern the way in which voting is done.


Directors and Company Secretary
-------------------------------

Directors elected by Shareholder who act in the best interest of the company. They should be honest, declare their interest in the company and aware of the company's trading position.

Directors split into executive and non-executive directors.

Executive directors work for the company, non-executive directors paid for the knowledge of the industry.

Company Secretary produce statutory returns to the companies house. Can be any person in the company.
