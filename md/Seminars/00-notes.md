## RWN: A new approach to supervised learning from Big Data

by Xizhao Wang *Fellow; IEEE Editor-in-Chief, IJMLC*



### Introduction to Big Data

The internet, financial institutions, media, medical treatment, scientific research, etc. provide a huge amount of data.

This data is only increasing in size. Big Data is the explosion of information.

Storing Big Data is, as expected, very difficult.

#### Variety

Structured data is becoming unstructured.

#### Velocity

Moving from batch jobs to the streaming of data.

#### Volume

Now around Zettabytes of data around.


#### Value

### Uncertainty of Big Data

There is lots of uncertainty in Big Data, there can be a lot of ambiguity in symbolic data, etc.

### Difficulties in learning from Big Data

### RWN

### Recent works related to Big Data

## Smart Vunerabilities

*Martyn Thomas CBE FREng*

### Smart Buildings

Offer significant benefits **and new vulnerabilities**.

#### Benefits

* Access Passes, Attendance monitoring, follow me printing
* Calendar, room booking, etc.
* CCTV, WiFi, Remote and central monitoring and control
* Dynamic displays, emergency messages, fire alarms

#### Vulnerabilities

* Denial of access, unauthorised access, data compromise
* Disruption, wasted energy, damage
* Intrusion, loss of control,
* Safety.

### Smart Cars

Michael Barr's expert report in the Bookout v Toyota lawsuit.  [See here](http://www.safetyresearch.net/Library/BarrSlides_FINAL_SCRUBBED.pdf).

### Safety World

Safety world works on probabilities, but in security there is a direct attacker - can't argue independence.

### Smart Meter Security

End-to-end security: "No trusted components".

Whether this works or not is unknown.

#### Vulnerabilities

* Meters contain clocks and billing data, if these are changed, bills can be manipulated.
* Meters contain an off switch, misuse could cause distress, harm or substantial disruption.
* Meter firmware will need to be updated.
* The Gas meter can only handle low-grade encryption.

##### Who controls the off switch?

Anyone who has the authority to send the relevant messaged through the DCC.

Anyone who can mount a successful **cyber attack** on the network.

##### How will security be assured?

* Human review of the spec.s
* Testing the system
* Focuesed pentesting

Testing only shows that faults **do** exist, not that there are no faults.

For high confidence you need formal methods.

### Cyber Security

Is a through-life discipline.

* Planning
* Control
* Monitoring
* Response



* From design through to decommissioning
* Lifetimes of 20+ years
* Don't run anti-virus
* Monitoring is difficult (and uncommon)
* How to respond to incidents?
* Insider threats
* Lifetime security needs discipline and excellent configuration control through years of maintenance and upgrades.

### [M2M and the IoT](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2014/01/theres-no-good-way-to-patch-the-internet-of-things-and-thats-a-huge-problem/)

### Cyber Security

Is a tier one threat.
