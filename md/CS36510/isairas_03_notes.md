# ISAIRAS 03 Paper:

* Discusses:
    * What robotic systems can currently do (2003)
    * Major space-related challenges
    * What we can plausibly expect in a decade (2013)

* Paper also discusses capabilities that require technological breakthroughs which by their very nature are unpredictable.

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1: Robots for planetary surface exploration

Sojourner,  MER, K9 and FIDO (these are JPL robots) - used to explain current
state of the art

Future (capabilities that we need (2003)):

* Autonomous navigation - now quite well established (2012)
    * Stationary rover
    * Takes and processes images
    * Works out next locomotion activity
    * During traverse, cameras off - blind traverse

* Real time characterisation of obstacles- still not developed (2012)
    * Seen obstacle captured by camera
    * What sort of material is obstacle
    * Is it hard and solid or soft?

* Self-awareness - capability for monitoring and responding to system health and safety

* Scientists interacting directly with rovers using high level goals e.g. "get me that sample" 

## 1.2 Robots for In-space operations

### Past:

* Talks about the past :- space shuttles + canada arm
* AERCam sprint

### Future (by 2013):

* Mechanical dexterity will exceed that of an astronaut
* Autonomous assembly and maintainence in space - near term capability


## 1.3 Common Challenges faced

* Robustness = ability to function in the presence of faults or unexpected
  anomalous conditions. This is a significant challenge
    * Tend to draw from past experience
* The paper discusses whole system design - this is the key to basic success
  and robustness - in fact generally this can be said for any robotic mission.
  Entire system design is required. Look at things like:
    * Power
    * Communications
    * Navigation
    * Maintainence
    * Human Component
 as a whole system.

* Mission competence - shift from the human directing the minute-to-minute
  activities of the robot, to a more automated approach. Deals with higher
  level commands like "explore that area and report anything interesting"
* Virtual presence - virtual tele-presence on Mars or whatever - Virtual
  Reality. Trying to get 'Arm Chair' planetary space exploration. Big comms
