# General Issues of locomotion

* Problems depend on the platform you are using.

* Centre of gravity

* Design robot environment and medium

# Wheeled vehicles

* Passive wheels
* Steering wheels
* Combinations of both
* Omnidirectional wheels:
    * 4 omnidirectional wheels means it can turn on the spot
* 3 wheeled robots: 2 wheel differential drive and a third point of contact

# Tracks

* Keeping the tracks on
* Skid turning


# Robotic Control Architectures

## Legged robot systems

* cross things like holes and pits - more adaptable than wheels etc
* uses a lot more power
* more mechanically complex
* Static and dynamic stability

## Bipedal robots

* Statically stable within limits
* No dynamic stability
* Must use servos all the time to stay still
* Control is still a problem

## Passive walkers

* Walk down hills with no control or actuation
* Very clever idea but no way to control them
* Careful tuning of robot to the environment its in.

## Legged systems

Static stable walkers: 

* Always in a stable equilibrium
* Not biologically plausible - not how we work
* Control first, morphology second
* Low energy efficiency

Dynamic stable walkers:

* Center of gravity is outside of the foot area
* Mostly not in stable equilibrium
* Biologically plausible
* Morphology - controlled falling over
* Energy efficiency is high - just goes with the flow
* Weak manoeuverability - no steps


# four legged robot systems

* Static - stable while standing
* Control needed when moving legs to make it walk properly
* Aibo dog robot - games driven research
* 4 legs - 2 motors
* Synchronisation and de-synchronisation allow different gait patterns for turning etc.

* More legs means more stability - even when walking.

# Flying robot systems

* flying gondolas and stuff
* Affected by the weather
* Useful for difficult to access and hostile areas.
