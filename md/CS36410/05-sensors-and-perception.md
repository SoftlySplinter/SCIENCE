# Sensors and Perceptions

* Humans have bloody good sensory perception:
    * Visioon
    * Touch
    * Hearing
* Robots don't have the perception of human beings!
* Robots can use sensors to perceive their own performance
* Biological sensors: sensory receptors
* Interpretation of the values is important

## Passive sensors

* No interaction with environment - purely observational:
    * Temperature sensors
    * Light sensors

## Active Sensors

* Sensors put out energy into environment to change or enhance:
    * ultrasonic - echolocation etc
    * take more energy than passive sensors


## Active Sensing

* Moving the sensor around to get a better look at things - put on the end of a manipulator arm or something

## Sensor categories:

* Binary
* Analogue
* Digital
* Arrays:
    * Linear
    * 2D
    * IR sensitive skin
    * artificial skin
    
# Redundancy

Physical redundancy - two of the same sensor mounted on the robot
Logical redudancy - using two different sensors to calculate the same thing.

## Common sensors

* Shaft encoder - direction and speed
* Accelerometer - acceleration on one axis
* Inclinometer
* Compasses - use magnetic fields for absolute alignment - keep away from motors and speakers
* GPS - pretty good these days, outdoors
* Sonar - sometimes bounces off walls and stuff
    * Quite noisy sensors
    * They have interference and refraction
    
 * Cameras
    * Interpret pixel values
    * Manufacturers more concerned with resolution - roboticists want better frame rates
    * Using cameras and hyperbolic mirrors!
    * Moving cameras: pan, tilt, verge systems
 * 3D laser scanners
     * Notoriously noisy
     * Useful for mapping environments
     
## The Perception problem

* Lots of readings but how to interpret them?
* Reactive vs deliberative actions
