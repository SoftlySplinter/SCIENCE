# SEM5640 - Developing Advanced Internet-Based Applications

This module builds on SE31520 examining further the development processes, techniques and technologies for constructing Internet-based, distributed software systems. Particular emphasis is placed on studying and applying enterprise design patterns. Students, working in small groups, will build, using a modern software engineering methodology, a distributed application that employs the technologies and concepts taught in this and previous modules.

## Introduction

*Provides a road-map to the module, with a brief overview of main concepts and how they interrelate.*

### Learning Outcomes

1. Analyse a complex software engineering problem.
2. Within a group design and implement an original solution to the problem.
3. Test and critically evaluate their solution.
4. Critically assess the relative merits of various software development methodologies within the context of the given problem and nature of the project team.
5. Working in a group, apply the chosen software development methodology to solve the given problem.
6. Critically explain the relative merits of alternative server-side technologies.
7. Demonstrate a critical appreciation of design issues encountered when developing multi-tier, distributed applications.

### Assessment

* Group Programming project and report **75%**
* Exam **25%**

## Construction Technologies

*Examination of technical solutions for building enterprise applications as provided by enterprise Java and .NET for building distributed applications. These include support for server-side MVC, e.g. JavaServer Faces and ASP.NET MVC; business objects, e.g. Enterprise JavaBeans; object to relational mapping, e.g. MS LINQ, Java Persistence API; messaging systems, e.g. Java Messaging Service; interoperability, e.g. SOAP-based web services.*

## Design Issues

*A number of enterprise application design patterns will be reviewed within the context of technologies discussed in 2. Building multi-tier applications requires developers to know more than just technologies, they must also know and use design techniques suited to their development. Students will learn about reusable enterprise design patterns, and in particular those used for the development of distributed, multi-tier applications.*

## Wider Issues

*Examination of current issues that are related to 2 and 3, e.g. scalability; approaches to testing and deployment; the use of cloud computing.*
