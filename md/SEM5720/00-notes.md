# SEM5720 - The Internet And How It Really Works

The Internet is a complex, multi-organisation network reaching nearly all parts of the world. The functioning of this network and the applications running upon it depend on a complex set of protocols. This module addresses the fundamental aspects of the most important issues that permit the network and its applications to operate successfully. The module also addresses the current threats to the Internet and topics still emerging from R&D studies around the world.

## Introduction

*This module discusses the detailed underlying operation of the Internet and its constituent components and is an essential topic in its own right as well as providing a solid foundation for much of the other material covered in the MEng.*

### Learning Outcomes

1. Participate in planning networks that are cost effective and realistic in terms of products and services currently available.
2. Critically assess proposed networking solutions.
3. Assess the effect of likely technological developments on existing network applications.
4. Make decisions and provide guidance to others in the choice of appropriate communications technologies to deploy, to solve real world requirements.
5. Demonstrate extensive knowledge of the internal operation of the Internet and its protocols.
6. Demonstrate an appreciation of the problems that appear in the management of routing and naming in large networks.
7. Exercise judgment in the choice of appropriate protocols and services to address the real needs of Internet operators and users.
8. investigate, and propose solutions to problems of quality of service.
9. Demonstrate an appreciation of the security issues that surround the Internet and its applications and how these can be mitigated.
10. Explain the need for a new generation of the Internet and describe current progress towards it.

## Basic Issues in Data Communication

*A revision of the basic issues in data communication.*

## Local Area Networks

*A detailed study of variants of the technologies collectively known as Ethernet.*

## Other Network Technologies

*A brief look at fast and wireless network technologies.*

## Standards

*The ISO OSI model.*

## Unicast Network Level Protocols

*Unicast Network Level Protocols in use in today's Internet. Including further study of protocols such as IPv4, ICMP, ARP, RARP used in unicast applications and IPv4 and IGMP used in multicast applications.*

## Unicast Routing in the Internet

*Example routing problems. Interior and exterior routing protocols. Protocols covered will include RIP, OSPF and BGP.*

## Multicast Routing in the Internet

*Example routing problems. Protocols covered will include PIM-DM, PIM-SM and MSDP. We will also cover the role of the Rendezvous Point, Anycast IP, and issues still under debate in the technical community.*

## Transport Level Protocols

*An in-depth study addressing the behaviour of TCP and UDP. Connection establishment and termination, flow control under various load conditions, timeouts and retransmission, newer features and performance.*

## Naming and Directory Services

*Including the DNS and LDAP and their use.*

## Quality of Service

*The need for and the provision of Quality of Service (QoS) within packet based networks such as the Internet which are inherently best efforts at heart.*

## Security Issues

*The inherent risks within networks such as the Internet, hacking, viruses, trojans, worms and denial of service attacks. The role of the Firewall and the problems it can bring.*

## Current and Future Issues

*The (still) emerging IPv6 protocol and other active issues.*
