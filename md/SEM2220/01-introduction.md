### Motivation

In 2012 the whole mobiles ecosystem's revenue was $1,551 billion; equivalent to 2.2% of global GDP. 

5% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate).

These are only projected figures, the picture is much bigger than this as this only includes money which takes into account the money which stays within the ecosystem (doesn't include ecommerce, etc.). The affect is much higher.

### Mobile Landscape

Constantly changing given that its a new market. The iPhone was the real kickstarter for this in 2007.

[Timeline](https://gsmaintelligence.com/timeline/) of the history mobile telephones.

Difference between "smart" and "feature" phones.

Mobile subscribers are growing 4 times faster than the global population. Reducing now (especially in the West) due to market saturation.

More scope for growth in developing countries.

Asia Pacific accounts for approximately half of global subscribers.

Total sim-enabled connections (including machine to machine (M2M) connections). Estimated 7.6% CAGR 2012-2017. Percentage of M2M connections is increasing rapidly.

Multiple devices (tables/phones/etc.) allow growth in sim-enabled connections.

Mobile data traffic is increasing rapidly. Video speculated to be one of the most rapidly increasing traffic.

### Mobile versus Desktop

Over time the sales of desktops (PCs & Laptops) is decreasing while the sale of mobile devices is increasing.

### Some predictions by GSMA

* Asia predicted to add approx. 50% of all connections/subscribers between 2013-17
* Same period Latin America and Africa next 20%
* Subscriber growth in developed nations slowing (e.g. 1% in UK)
* Total data traffic load in 2012 was 0.9 Exabyte/month).
* Predicted to be 11.2 EB/mth.


### Chief Stakeholders

* Network operators
* Content providers
* OS vendors
* Device vendors

### Fragmentation and Differentiation

Issue of fragmentation and differentiation, related to:
* the number of OS variants, 
* the number of device vendors wishing to customise the OS, 
* different browsers,
* Network operators and device vendors do not like commoditisation.
  * Don't want to be treated like commodities which are values on price.

Top 25 ranked apps in 2012 take 15% of all revenue. Only 2% of App Store newcomers get into the top 250 apps.

Free apps are becoming more of a norm, especially with the saturation of android.

### Mobile Network Operators

Revenues are decreasing due to over-the-top services (i.e. using online services over SMS or phone calls).

Operators will push, via their shop sales-assistant commission, those devices they gain the biggest discounts on.

High profile phones promoted, often Android.

Apple disrupts this model due to a locked mindshare.

Psychological hook of "cheap" contract phones. Free now, pay later ideology.

Billing relationship with the customer. Paying for things using your mobile account rather than via a bank account (directly). Small transaction fee for this service to generate revenue.

* 48% of the world's population do not have a bank account.

Something for the future, not quite so prevalent at the moment.

### Rich Communication Service

Threat of over the top (OTT) services such as Skype. Quality of service is currently an issue here, but voice call is growing very slowly (13% in 2008 to 4% 2012).

GSMA responded by developing a Rich Communication Service specification. Only aimed at long term evolution (LTE) networks (4G). Aims to provide this as a universal service. 17 different implementations by MNOs including AT&T, Telefonica, Verizon and Verdafon.

### Device Vendors (OEMs)

Nokia sales falling. Haven't kept up with the trends.

Samsung now the major player. Mainly due to their adoption of Android.

Apple improving with mobiles.

RIM/Blackberry are focusing on development.

Building an Android smartphone involves:

* Choosing an OS.
* OEMs design phone (HW, UX, required changes to the Android OS UX) plus apps to include.
* Marketing.
* Negotiations with MNOs to arrange bulk discounts.
* Production test units sent to MNOs, app developers and Google.
* Phone is shipped to MNOs and independent stores
* MNOs customise with their own apps.
* Sales to public plus marketing.

Can also go down the stock phone route.

Inception to market is approximately around 6 months when based on an existing OS.

Apple is a little easier to to the locked-in syndrome.

### Types of Phone

* Basic Phones
  * Call and SMS support only.
* Feature Phones
  * No touch screen
  * Browser becoming standardised.
* Smart Phones
  * Definition changes year-on-year.
  * Expectations change a lot.
  * More sensors and technology.
* Phablets
  * Large smartphones.
* Tablets
  * Same functionality as smartphones, often without SIM.
* Slates
  * Large tablets.
* Non-phone devices
  * iPod touch
  * eBook readers
  * Google Glass
  * Watches like the Apple Pebble.
  * Rely on bluetooth or similar.

### Operating System Vendors

Android leading market player.

iOS popular.

Symbian (dead now) and Blackberry not doing well.

Windows Phone a late starter.

### Android Fragmentation

There are 24 listed Android device manufacturers but at least 259 different device models currently on sale.

Lots of different screen sizes, resolutions, hardware capability, etc.

There is only one manufacturer for Apple products.

Version 4.1+ *Jelly Bean* most prevalent, but versions 4.0, 3.0 and 2.3 are still a large market share.

Security problems, most malware attacks on Android.

iOS is mostly all the same version. However, companies often prescribe a 2-3 purchase cycle. Corporate world might need to take into account older versions.

Google allow fragmentation to make Android more interesting to OEMs, However this can get in the way of updates.

Webkit configuration varies; browser fragmentation.

Tried to stop fragmentation in version 3, but this lead to new forks. So this has been re-introduced in version 4.

### Fragmentation and Differentiation

Differentiation gives a unique selling point (USP) for vendors. Sticking with the same model.

Fragmentation leads to security issues and makes the OS more complex to handle screen sizes, etc. More testing needed. Therefore increased cost.

### Windows Phone 8

Microsoft and Nokia. A closed environment (or "walled garden").

No fragmentation/differentiation. Very few OEMs interested.

### How to join the OS game?

Buy into it.

Web as OS platform. Firefox OS is trying hard with cheap alternatives. HTML5, JS, CSS3 and APIs to access hardware.

Very fragmented, depending on rendering engine.

### Mobile Webkits are not always the same

Can be configured differently. Must be careful with mobile websites.

Depends on location too (UC Browser more popular than Android in Asia).

### Proxy versus full browsers.

Opera mini, for example.

* HTTP request (encrypted)
* Proxy Server
  * Target HTTP Server resources
  * Renders page
  * Compresses into an image map
* Image map returned to Opera mini (encrypted).

Cheaper and faster over a slow network. Very popular in certain developing countries with low bandwidth.

Cheap in terms in processing too.

JS is handled by the proxy server. Not always perfect and may not be enabled.

### Content Providers

App Stores

* Apple App Store is a walled garden. 70% developer revenue.
* Google Play. 70% developer revenue.
* Amazon Android Appstore.
* Others (apk) security issues with this.

## Objective-C

*A quick primer on Obj-C*

### Basic Syntax and Objects


#### Logging and Strings

```objc
NSLog(@"Message");

NSString *var = @"Some message";
NSLog(@"Message: %@.", var);
```

#### Booleans

```objc
BOOL true = YES;
BOOL false = NO;
```

#### Numbers

```objc
NSNumber *num = @10;

// Conversion to unsigned int
NSUInteger uInt = [num unsignedIntegerValue];
```

#### Arrays

```objc
NSArray *arr = @[...];

// Accessing elements
arr[index];

// Something about NSArrays being immutable objects.
```

#### Dictionaries

```objc
NSDictionary *dict = @{@"key": @"value"};

// Accessing
NSString *val = dict[@"key"];
```

### Objects and Messages

Messages are Objective-C's version of methods, where the Java syntax would be:

```java
ObjectName.methodName()
```

The Objective-C syntax is:

```objc
[objectName messageName]
```

Example:

```objc
NSArray *temp = @[@"Test", @"2"];

NSLog(@"%@", [temp description]);
// Logs information about temp
```

#### Storing the output of Messages

Just need to worry about typing

```objc
NSArray *temp = @[@"Test", @"2"];
NSString *result = [temp description]
NSLog(result);
```

#### Parameters

Messages can have parameters, however they may act differently than expected.

```objc
[object methodName:parameter namedParameter:value]
```

#### Initialisation

```objc
[[Class alloc] init];
```

### Conditionals and Loops

```
if(condition) {
    // ...
} else if(condition) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}
```

```
switch(thing) {
    case value:
        // ...
        break;
}
```

```
for(Class *item in iterable) {
    // ...
}
```

### Blocks

Blocks are like basic methods.

```objc
void (^block)(void) = ^{
    // ...
};
```

Inkoving a block:

```objc
block();
```

### Classes

In a header file:

```objc
@interface Name : NSObject
@property Type *name;
@property NSString *myName;
@end
```

Implementing the interface:

```objc
#import Name.h

@implementation Name
@end
```

Accessing properties

```objc
Name *name = [[Name alloc] init];
name.myName = @"Value";
```
