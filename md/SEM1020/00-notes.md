# SEM1020 - Current Issues in Software Engineering

This module focuses on current issues in the field of Software Engineering. The module will involve students in an examination of current research literature of interest to software engineers.

## Introduction

It is okay to produce a paper based on my own paper :-)

### Learning Outcomes

1. Identify and use the main research resources that are available to software engineers
2. Constructively participate in advanced technical debate in the field.
3. Have a general overview of the field of Software Engineering and be aware of focused areas of research interest within it.
4. Present current research at an appropriate level of detail to a technical audience.
5. Produce a survey paper on some current area of Software Engineering research.

### Assessment

* Participation and Contribution **15%**
* Survey Paper (9000 words) **60%**
* Poster **25%**

## How to Read a Scientific Paper

Papers provides a good view of what is happening now. Journal papers give a more out of date view than conference papers. Blogs typically give the most up-to-date view but are least verifiable.

Papers should give enough information that there is enough information to replicate the experiment.

It will show some actual data.

### Steps

1. Read the abstract, check the information will be relevant
2. Read the conclusion and discussion, check the results agree with the abstract and if they are still relevant.
3. Read the introduction, check you understand the background information and see if you need to look up more items to understand this paper.
4. Read the results. Usually tables and figures are provided to show the data.

Now the methods become important, it gives details on how the experiment was set up and carried out. Try to pick out the basic methods and work upwards.

References provide a way of tracking back through the sources.

## Paper Presentations

Set down for presenting Abstract State Machines (Feb 28) and Swarm Robotics (Mar 28) and asking questions on Biological Data Sharing (Mar 14) and Swarm Robotics (Apr 4).

## Literature Review/Survey Paper

9000 words of pure gold.

May address *any* aspect of software engineering.

MSc should probably review the literature of their project.
