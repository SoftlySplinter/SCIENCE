# SEM5640 - Developing Advanced Internet-Based Applications

This module builds on SE31520 examining further the development processes, techniques and technologies for constructing Internet-based, distributed software systems. Particular emphasis is placed on studying and applying enterprise design patterns. Students, working in small groups, will build, using a modern software engineering methodology, a distributed application that employs the technologies and concepts taught in this and previous modules.

*Nigel Hardy awesome tally: 2*

### Assessment

* Group Programming project and report **75%**
* Exam **25%**

### Internet Applications

* Uses network connection
* Browser-based
* Client-server model
* Reliance of collection of internet standards (e.g. HTTP)

### Advanced Internet Applications

* AJAX/Plugins support to provide a client rich experience
* Multiple Application/Servers
* Distributed or more complex processing
* Transaction (DB) support
* REST/SOAP or other remote procedure calls

No precise definition.

### Overview

There are several themes this module will look at:

* Multi-Tier Internet Applications
* Developing using .NET and Java EE
* Design Patterns
  * MVC
  * ORM
* Web Services
  * REST
  * SOAP
  * RMI/RPC
* Building Applications
  * Cloud Computing
  * Structure and deployment

#### Multi-Tier Internet Applications

Applications that involve multiple servers which run different parts of the application so that the business logic is separated from the presentation logic.

Different parts tend to include:

* Client
* Web
* Business Logic
* Data/EIS

Lots of small applications which build up a larger, more complex, application.

Communication between the servers provides the linkage between the applications.

Supports scalability if done correctly. Also more resistant to failure. Potentially more secure (more important servers firewalled).

Should all be transparent to the user.

### Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE)

* Building web applications
* JavaServer Faces
* Enterprise Java Beans
* Portability

#### .NET

* Building web applications
* Web Forms, MVC
* C#
* Tiers and layers

#### Design Patterns

Two types of issues:

##### Patterns of Enterprise Architecture

* Building and structuring the application
* Relate to .NET and Java

##### Patterns of Enterprise Integration

* Making applications communicate
* Examples:
  * Apache Camel
  * Apache ActiveMQ

#### Building Applications

Using Cloud computing and how relevant it really is.

Examples from eBay of structure and deployment.

#### Web Services

Application that provide services which have destination endpoints with operations.

SOAP XML, WSDL and REST are the big players.

Alternatives to REST?

## Construction Technologies

*Examination of technical solutions for building enterprise applications as provided by enterprise Java and .NET for building distributed applications.*

These include:
* support for server-side MVC, e.g. JavaServer Faces and ASP.NET MVC; 
* business objects, e.g. Enterprise JavaBeans; 
* object to relational mapping, e.g. MS LINQ, Java Persistence API; 
* messaging systems, e.g. Java Messaging Service;
* interoperability, e.g. SOAP-based web services.

### Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)

Java is a language (JDK) and a platform (JRE).

The platform is the Java Virtual Machine and a set of APIs.

Four platforms:

1. Java Standard Edition (SE)
2. Java Enterprise Edition (EE)
3. Java Mobile Edition (ME)
4. Java FX

#### Java EE

A superset of Java Set, providing a development model, APIs and runtime environment (the server).

> *"For developing and running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable and secure network systems"* - The Oracle BS

#### Java EE Web Tier

Access the web tier with HTTP(S).

Provides static resources and dynamic page generation. Handles client input and navigation flow with maintance of state.

JavaBeans provide temporary storage on the Web Tier.

Can do simple logic, could build the whole application in this tier, but would be a bad design.

#### Java EE Business Tier

Provides Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) components.

Access to Java Logic, etc. which provide the business logic.

#### Java EE Enterprise Information System (EIS) Tier

Logically and typically on other machines, typically "foreign" technology.

#### Other Clients

Can build Java Applications or Web Applications which access the EJB components directly. Uses remote procedure calls.

#### Java EE Application Server

Provides:

* The JVM and core APIs
* The EE APIs
* Component containers
  * component lifecycle management
    * creation
    * association
  * services to components
    * security
    * transaction management
    * directory lookup
    * remote connectivity

##### Containers

A set of Java classes packaged into a jar file.

Can be deployed using either:

* XML descriptors
* Java annotations

Annotations are widely used, but can be overriden by descriptors.

Components plus deployment descriptors make up a module, each for one container type.

Four types of EE modules:

* Web modules `.war`
* EJB modules `.jar`
* Application client modules `.jar`
* Resource Adapter Modules `.rar`

A set of modules makes up a Enterprise archive: `.ear`

#### Servlets

Servlets are the olderest EE web component.

Servlets act as a dynamic page, which have a URL, and must receive a HTTP request, from this it generates a HTTP response.

Is a Java object with a managed lifecycle.

Extension of `javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet` class.

##### Lifecycle

Managed by the web container.

The first call is:

* Load class
* Create an instance
* Call `init()`

Any call:

* Handle the HTTP request

Perhaps calls `destroy()`

Only one instance is needed by a running server.

##### Handling Requests

The `HttpServlet` class has stubs for all the HTTP methods `doGet(...)` etc.

`service()` method used to handle the finding of appropriate methods for the HTTP headers.

Common to use the same method to handle `GET` and `POST` (for some strange reason, this sounds bad).

###### Request

Provides access to:

* Call details
* Parameters
* Body
* A reader
* Context

###### Response

Provides access to:

* Response code
* Headers
* A writer (for the body)

##### Forwarding

Can forward requests to other servlets, passing on the request and response objects. Used for branching on context, for example.


```java
RequestDispatcher d = req.getRequestDispatcher('name');
d.forward(req, resp)
```

##### Instance Variables and Servlets

A servlet could have instance variables, however these variables are not specific to a connection, rather the whole servlet.

There may also be multiple servlets so there is no guarantee that these will be the same.

Need features for session data.

Reminder that HTTP is stateless.

##### Sessions

The request must carry some identification of the session, server usually generates this information.

* Parameters
* Cookies

Remember EU Cookie Law

##### Error Redirects

Specified in the `web.xml` descriptor.

#### Useful Features

* Templating
* Validation & Schemas
* i18n
* Security
* Database access
* Support for good design patterns
* Tight Integration
* Testing Frameworks
* Web Service support

Generally: higher level libraries and code reuse.

#### i18n and L10n

Internationalisation and localisation are both important. Don't hardcode for the locale, instead store translations in DB or files and load them dynamically.

#### Authentication

#### Authorization

#### Testing

Use JUnit where possible (with mocks, stubs, etc.)

Can test Java Beans using an embedded EJB Container.

Service testing is slightly more difficult

##### Service Testing

Testing the resources in an automated way to avoid manual input.

Provides rapid and reliable regression testing.

Handles:

* HTTP(S)
* FTP
* LDAP
* JMS
* Mail
* SOAP

Specify calls, with parameters or sequences.

Selenium or JMeter are options (JMeter also does load testing).

JMeter also has a NetBeans plugin.

### .NET

Microsoft framework for developing and deploying applications with:

* Cloud (Azure)
* Web Server
* Desktop
* Restricted Resource Devices and Mobile Phones

Similarities with Java (JRE).

Focused on Windows, but can run on other platforms through mono.

#### Overview

![](http://misc.alexanderdbrown.com/dotNET.png)

##### Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The .NET JRE effectively.

Loads and executes .NET "managed code".

CLR loads code into application domains to provide a level of isolation and the ability to stop and remove a domain.

Provides Just In Time (JIT) compilation, memory management and GC.

Security based one roles and defined by policies.

##### Building and Deploying Code

1. Compile source code files.
2. Combine IL (MSIL), metadata, config files and other resources into assembly files.
  * DLL or EXE extensions
    * DLL is a library module
    * EXE is only type that will activate the CLR
3. Deploy Applications to CLR


#### Internet Information Services (IIS)

The application server which runs ASP.NET applications.

### Server-Side MVC

Methods for implementing the MVC pattern in an Web Application.

#### JavaServer Faces (JSF)

Provides:

* Templating
  * Facelets
  * JavaServer Pages (JSP)
* Validators
* MVC Pull
* Navigation
  * Fixed
  * Dynamic
* AJAX
* i18n/L10n
* Session Management
* DB Access
  * JDBC
  * ORM frameworks
* Testing Frameworks
* Code reuse
* Web Services and resources

##### Basic Technology

Basic Api for represention components and managing their state; handling events, server-side validation and data conversion; defining page navigation; supporting i18n and accessibility; and providing extensibility.

A tag library for adding components to web pages and connecting components to server-side objects.

##### Expression Language

Like most scripting languages `$` and `#` are used.

`${expr}` are *rvalues* (read-only) and are processed immediately.

`#{expr}` are *lvalues (read-write) and have deferred evaluation. Also used for method expressions.

`${object.variable}` calls `object.getVariable()` under the covers.

`#{object.method}` calls `object.method()`.

##### Faces

A replacement for JavaServer Pages (which are now deprecated).

Write (X)HTML with special tags which have an XML appearance which will be rendered as HTML with functionality behind it.

`<h:body>` is the top level tag.

All pages will tend to act like a form, so `<h:form>` is very commonly used, even in cases where there would not normally be a form.

##### Common Attributes

* `id`
* `style` to associate CSS
* `rendered` is a condition to check is the element should be rendered on the page. The condition can be an expression from the Expression Language.
* `value` the value of the component, again this can be from the Expression Language, which links the view to the model.

##### Composite Components

Built from standard components.

These can be parametrised and stored in `resources`; they have a namespace (default: `http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/composite/ezcomp`)

```xml
<!DOCTYUPE html PUBLIC ...>
<html xmlns="..."
      xmlns:cc = "..."
      xmlns:h = "...">

<!-- INTERFACE -->
<cc:interface>
  <cc:attribute name="x" required="true" />
</cc:interface>

<!-- IMPLEMENTATION -->
<cc:implementation>
  <p>
    <h:outputLabel for="i" value="Repeats" />
    <h:inputText id="i" value="{cc.attrs.x}" />
    <h:message for="repeat" />
  </p>
</cc:implementation>
```

##### Templating

Can create template pages which has values to fill in. The inheriting page has to fill in these values.

##### Navigation

Write navigation rules in XML, each rule is a page (view). For each page there is a set of outcomes (in string form). For each outcome a next page is specified.

Typically stored in `faces-config.xml`

Outcomes are generated from the `action` attributes from components.

There are implicit navigation rules which falls back to a matching page if it can be found.

##### Converters

Implement `javax.faces.convert.Converter`

Have associated error string displayed if conversion fails (`<h:messages>`).

Number of default converters for most Java Objects and primitives.

Converters are used in four ways:

1. Bind the component to a managed bean property of the right type (default).
2. Put the converter class in the component's `converter` attribute.
3. For numbers and dates, nest the `f:convertDateTime` or `f:convertNumber` tag inside the component.
4. Put the `f:converter` tag inside the component and refer to the converter (general purpose tag).

##### Events & Listeners

Part of the component model, application events are generated by components (ultimately from the rendered page).

The JSF application can map HTTP requests to the specific handling code.

Two types of event:

1. Application event; when the user activates a component that implements `ActionSource` (buttons, links, etc.).
2. Value-change event; when the users changes the value of a component represented by `UIInput`.

Listeners cause the application to respond to events:

1. Implement an event listener class to handle the event and register it to a component.
2. Implement a method of a managed bean and refer to it in the EL attribute in the component tag.

##### Validators

Similar to converters, but only provide validation.

Implement `javax.faces.validator.Validator`

Again, default validators are provided.

Registered by:

1. nesting the validator's tag inside the component
2. Nesting the `f:validator` tag inside the component.

`BeanValidator` uses validation methods in the bean instead of having to write a separate class. Also allows the validation to be model-state specific.

###### Bean Validation

```java
public void validateVar(FacesContext context, UIComponent toValidate, Object value) {
    int input = (Integer) value; // cast the given value
    if(!condition) {
      ((UIInput) toValidate).setValid(false);
      FacesMessage message = newFacesMessage(
        "error message");
      context.addMessage(
        toValidate.getClientId(context), 
        message);
    }
}
```

##### Lifecycle

Starts when the client request a URL and ends with the server response.

#### ASP.NET

.NET Applications for the web, which uses:

* Web Forms - Event based
* Web Services - Application to Application
* MVC
* ASP.NET AJAX

##### View State

Stores the entire state in a hidden item in the form. Simplistic, but does affect performance and security.

Sent in base64.

Can disable for the entire page, or for specific elements.

Also have the ability to encrypt, `EnableViewStateMac` or store server-side.

##### Session State

There are different techniques which can be used to store session state:

* Cookies (bad)
* REST Requests (not stateful)
* Server Side session tokens (persistence/scalability questions)

ASP.NET uses server side session tokens:

```C#
String myVallue = "A. Name";
Session["name"] = myValue;
myVale = (String) Session["name"];
```

Can configure where the data is held. Can also turn off the requirement for cookies.

###### In Process (InProc)

Same as ASP.

###### SQL Server (SQLServer)

Store state in Microsoft's SQL Server, which can be on another machine.

###### StateServer

Store in a separate process, which can be on another machine.

###### Custom

Write your own mechanism.

###### Off


##### System.Web.UI.Page

Default base class for code-bheind filels.

Implements `System.Web.IHttpHandler`:

* `IsReusable()` - true if the handler can be pooled
* `ProcessRequest(` - Processes the actual HTTP request.

##### HTTP Pipeline

![HTTP Pipeline](http://misc.alexanderdbrown.com/asp.net/http_pipeline.png)

#### GridView and SQL DataSource

Ways of display DB data.

### Business Objects

Objects which relate to the business layer of a multi-tier application.

#### Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)

EJBs act as an ORM framework, where the Java Objects are annotated with the DB schema details.

Three types of EJB Session:

1. Stateful
2. Stateless
3. Singleton

Can also have message-driven beans.

Access can be done through:

* No-interface view (all the public methods are available)
* Through a business interface
* Injection
* JNDI

##### Transactions

A transaction is a unit of work which supports "ACID".


###### Atomic

Every task within a unit of work must complete successfully otherwise the transaction is aborted

###### Consistent

Atomicity, isolation, durability lead to consistent data. Developer must also define database consistency checks.

###### Isolated

Preventing interference from other transactions.

###### Durable

Data written to disc before a transaction can fully complete.

##### EJB Transactions
In EJB Transactions have a scope. A transaction manager manages this process.

EJBs support two types of transactions:

* Container managed
* Bean Managed

###### Container Managed Transactions

Transactional attributed specified using annotations or in the deployment descriptor.

Outside of the EJB code.

Reccommended

###### Bean Managed Tranasctions

Annotate EJB class with:

```java
@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagerType.BEAN)
```

Offers fine grained control.

##### EJB Transactions Attributes

Six types of transaction attributes, specified by annotations or descriptor.

The default is `Required`.

Can annotate the class to set the default for the class.

###### NotSupported

Transactions are not supported by the method, any current transaction will be suspended during this method call and resumed once it terminates.

###### Supports

Follows the caller; if it was in a transaction, it will remain so, if it was not, this will **not** create a new one.

###### Required

The method **must** be part of a transaction.

If the caller was not in a transaction, this will start one.

###### RequiresNew

This method will always crate a new transaction. An existing one will be suspended and will resume after this is complete.

The outer transaction will not roll-back if this one does.

Useful to nest transactions

###### Mandatory

Must already be in a transaction, otherwise a `TransactionRequiredException` will be thrown.

###### Never

Must never be in a transaction, otherwise a `RemoteException` will be thrown.

##### EJB Isolation

Problems:

* Dirty Reads
* Non-repeatable Reads
* Phantom Reads

Provide four (fairly standard) levels of transactions:

* `TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED`
* `TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED`
* `TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ`
* `TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE`

In bean-managed transaction, can specify isolation using the JDBC API: 

```java
connection.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE) ;
```

Using serializable guarantees data consistency, but may affect performance.

###### Read Uncommitted

Uncommitted changes are visible to other transactions, other transactions can change rows that another transaction has read.

May result in inconsistencies as a rollback by T1 may mean that T2s data is out of date.

###### Read Committed

Rows updated in a transaction cannot be read by another transaction, but rows read by one transaction can be changed by another.

Rows updated by T1 cannot be read by T2.

Rows read by T1 can be updated by T1 or T2.

###### Repeatable Read

Rows read by one transaction cannot be updated by any transactions.

Rows read by T1 cannot be updated by T1 or T2.

###### Serializable

Transaction (appears) to have a lock on the data.

##### EJB Transactions with Exceptions

Checked exceptions (including application exceptions) do not cause an automatic rollback, but can be set using `@ApplicationException(rollback=true)`

Unchecked exceptions and `RemoteException`s automatically cause a rollback and the EJB instance is discarded.

##### Injections

Getting a reference to object instances without instantiation or passing in as parameters, providing good decoupling.

There are two mechanisms for this:

1. Resource Injection
2. Dependency Injection

Annotations to fields or methods specify the injection points.

Provides a  runtime binding which provides inversion of control.

Compatible abstractions are required to avoid typing errors; the code using an object is not responsible for choosing an implementation or creating the instance.

Injection is often the implementation for this, but can use:

* Factories
* Service Locators
* Contextualised lookup

##### Resource Injection

Inject references to objects in the JNDI namespace into any container-managed object.

Gets a reference to a resource using: 

* Annotations
* Deployment Descriptor
* `InitialContext` lookup

Inject as an interface type, code independent of specific implementation.

Not type safe!

##### Variable Resource Injection

```java
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet
  @Resource(name="java:comp/DfeaultDataSource")
  private javax.sql.DataSource dsc;
}
```

##### Method Resource Injection

```java
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
  private javax.sql.DataSource dsc;

  @Resource(name="java:comp/DefaultDataSource")
  public void setDsc(javax.sql.DataSource dsc) {
    this.dsc = dsc
  }
}
```

Method name must being with `set`, with a `void` return type and only one parameter.

### Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

Libraries which provide a mapping from a relational database to objects in an object-orientated paradigm.

#### Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)

A query language for .NET languages which is akin to SQL.

#### Java Persistence API

Access to database at SQL level or through an ORM Framework

##### JDBC

Provides direct access to a database.

Only provides relational records, not Objects.

##### Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)

Access to naming and directory services, part of the Java SE API. Looks up objects by name, returning values or references.

API for the clients.

Service provider interface (SPI) wadds new directory and naming services.

##### Java Persistence API (JPA)

Provides an ORM mapping of Java Object using Java annotations. Provides:

* Create
* Retrieve
* Modify
* Write

*(So CUR<s>D</s> then? -A)*

Entities are JavaBeans, annotated with `@Entity`. Automatically mapped, but can label instance variables with extra details; `@Column` can map Java types to SQL types.

`@Id` is required.

*(JPA can be a real pain though, he glossed over this just a little bit -A).*

#### Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)

Any Java object can be made managed by its container. The CDI defines scpoes and a managed object has a declared (or default) scope.

This can then be injected into any other managed object.

##### Application Scoped

`@ApplicationScoped`

##### Session Scoped

`@SessionScoped`

##### Request Scoped

`@RequestScoped`

##### Conversation Scoped

`@ConversationScoped`

Covers the AJAX exchanged (can be extended using an ID)

##### Dependent

`@Dependent`

Inherits the scope from the object it is inserted into.

This is the default scope.

##### Injection

```java
import javax.inject.Inject

public class Printer {
  @Inject
  Greeting greeting;
}
```

##### Qualified Injection

```java
public class Printer {
  @Inject
  @Informal
  Greeting greeting;
}
```

Can create a subtype of Greeting which is annotated using `@Informal` to allow variants of a type.

### Messaging Systems

Acts as a middleware which decouples:

* time
* platform
* language

Which is usually machine-to-machine.

There are **a lot** of standards.

#### Models for Messaging Systems.

* Point-to-Point (queue)
* Publish/Subscribe
* Fanout
* Request/Response

#### Java Messaging Service

A Java API which "allows applications to create, send, receive and read messages using reliable, asynchronous, loosely coupled communication."

Requires an implementation.

Access Connection Factories or Queues using injection.

#### Message Brokers

Most patterns require middleware (all can use it).

Possible roles include:

* Routing
* Receiving
* Storing
  * Persistent
* Transmit
* Broadcast
* Translate
* Monitor

##### Brokers

JavaEE applcation servers must have one. Glassfish has Open MQ.

.NET has one part of the service bus.

Apache Active MQ is a good offering.

##### Security

Authentication & Authorisation, encryption of messages, integrity of messages, transactional, etc.

Some protocols and some implementation already on offer.

### Interoperability

Methods of performing B2B operation.

#### Socket Connections

Powerful, but not generally available as an API. Need a Domain Specific Language.

#### RESTful Web Services

Use HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` and `HEAD`) with a URI for the API. Return any form of data; usually XML, JSON or YAML.

Very constrained on header information.

#### Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based Web Services

Expressed as XML supporting interoperability (both Business to Business (B2B) and EAI).

Typically sent over HTTP but can use other network protocols.

Usually generated automatically using facilities in a program, but it is possible to create messages manually.

More popular than CORBA, extensible through the use of XML.

HTTP avoids firewalls.

Industry backing:

* Miscrosoft
* I've Been Moved (IBM)
* Oracle
* BEA
* HP
* SAP
* etc.

##### Structure

```HTTP
POST /webservice/OrderProcessing HTTP/1.1
...
```
```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8" ?>
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=“http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/”
  xmlns:xsd=“http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema”
  xmlns:ns1=“http://orders.borthdistributors.co.uk”>
  <soapenv:Header>
    <!-- Optional. Meta-data in form of header blocks. e.g.: security credentials, id, etc. -->
  </soapenv:Header>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <!-- Mandatory. Arbitrary application-specific XML data or elements that map to method/procedure calls or code that processes the XML document. Could be fault data -->
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Enveloper>
```

##### Web Services Description Language (WSDL)

SOAP manages the process of communicating information but doesn't define operations, data types or faults of the service.

WSDL is an XML description of a service, generally autogenerated by tools.

###### WSDL Elements

In the specification, there are the following eleents that define a service.

* **types** - the data types used that can be used in the messages
* **message** - the messages that can be transmitted, which also specifies the types used
* **portType** - the list of possible operations, linking the input and output messages
* **binding** - the link between a portType and the specific protocol settings
* **port** - the definition of a specific location that a particular binding is available.
* **service** - a collection of ports.

##### In .NET

Generates proxy code for you. A set of asynchronous methods are provided:

```C#
BeginMethodName(...)
EndMethodName(...)
```

##### Interoperability in SOAP

> How do you expose types as parameters and return values in a way which in interoperable?

Value types map onto XML Schema types, classes or structs are converted into complex types in the schema.

* Classes must be public
* Public fields and properties are serialised as elements
* Methods are not exposed.

Arrays and collections are supported by this, but not all types can be mapped easily (e.g. custome types where methods are used to provide access to calculated data). (*A: as you'd expect really*)

## Software Development Process

There is no such thing as a silver bullet for software development processes.

### Testing

Methods for testing a system.

#### White/Black Box Testing

A basis for which testing is built on

#### Unit Testing

Testing the smallest possible unit.

#### Functional Testing

Test that a part provides an expected function.

#### Non-functional Testing

Tests that a part will not fail to function under certain circumstances.

#### Integration/Subsystem Testing

Testing larger units of work combine together.

#### Verification Testing

Have we built the right thing?

Does it conform to standards.

#### System Testing

Our testing of the entire system.

#### Acceptance Testing

Testing the system is acceptable for the client.

### Formal Methods

Write a formal specification and then program to that specification so that something can be proved to have worked.

#### VDM

#### Z Notation

### Traditional Methods

Focus on up front design before development

#### Waterfall Model

1. Requirements
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintainace

#### Spiral Model

#### Iterative Development

### Agile Methods

Focus on providing features without large amounts of up-front development and client involvement.

#### Extreme Programming

Promotes no-one authorship of code with refractoring.

Planning game to put features.

Can use a metaphor to describe the system.

#### Test Driven Development

Write tests first then produce code to pass those tests (but no more).

#### Feature Driven Development

Break the system down into user stories, make these stories into features which can then be developed independently.

Need some overall architecture.

#### Rapid Application Development

Hack it until it works.

#### Scrum

Self organising teams with a focus on co-location of all team members and communication.

#### Model-Driven Engineering

1. Build a model
2. Test the model
3. Translate the model into executables

Platform Independent Model -> Platform Dependent Model.

Can use tools like executable UML.

### Open Source

Methods for developing software in a more unmanaged and dynamic way.

#### Cathedral

A big in-house style of development where every developer understands the big picture.

#### Bazaar

A very dynamic way of developing, which not every developer has the big picture, but understands their small parts, usually needs some figureheads.

#### Crowd Sourcing

Getting a large amount of people to come up with potential solutions and selecting the best ones.

#### Hacking

Playing with a system and getting it to do tasks it was not necessarily designed to do.

## Design Issues

*A number of enterprise application design patterns will be reviewed within the context of technologies discussed in 2. Building multi-tier applications requires developers to know more than just technologies, they must also know and use design techniques suited to their development. Students will learn about reusable enterprise design patterns, and in particular those used for the development of distributed, multi-tier applications.*

## Wider Issues

*Examination of current issues that are related to 2 and 3, e.g. scalability; approaches to testing and deployment; the use of cloud computing.*

### Load Balancing

Balance the load of the request across a number of different machines.

There are hardware and software solutions for performing this.

Benefits:

* Scalability
* Manageability
* Server and Content balancing

Has a single point of failure.

#### Round Robin

Allocate in a circular pattern

#### Least Connections

Allocate to the machine with the least connections

#### Response Times

Allocate to the machine with the quickest response time.

#### Server Probes

Gain even more information about the servers and allocate based on this.

#### Weighting

Apply a weighting to each machine and allocate accordingly.

### Scalability

* Partition by function
* Split horizontally
* Avoid distributed transactions
* Decouple functions asynchronously
* Move processing to asynchronous flow
* Virtualise at all levels
* Cache appropriately

#### Scaling

* Scale horizontally (scale out) is preferential. Adding more machines
* Scale vertically (scale up). Upgrade machines

Cost basis - try to keep on commodity hardware.

#### Partition Everywhere

Functional segmentation into logical function (example is the database; split the database into the segments, continue splitting until no more splits can be made).

Horizontal split using an internal ORM implementation, requires additional routing.
