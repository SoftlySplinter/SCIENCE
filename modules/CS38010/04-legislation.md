Legislation
===========



Criminal Law
------------
Represents society's view of what is acceptable behaviour and what is not. The police (and some 
other agencies) are responsible for apprehending those who break criminal law.

Society brings then before a court and punishment takes the form of imprisonment, a fine, 
community service, etc.


Civil Law
---------
Regulates the relationship between people. Action is initiated by the aggrieved party (the 
*claimant*, formerly - and still in the USA - the *plaintiff*).


Standards of Proof
------------------
To convict someone of criminal offence, the prosecution must prove *beyond reasonable doubt* that
the defendant is guilty.

To obtain a judgement in a civil court, it is only necessary to establish the facts *on the 
balance of probabilities*.


Natural persons and legal persons
---------------------------------
Civil law is concerned with relationships between people. Therefore, unless a company is 
incorporated (a legal person) civil law is not applicable to a company.


Common Law
----------
Common law works by precedent (based on previous judgements). The judge may decide that a previous
judgement is no longer applicable. All countries are considered in common law.


Case Law
--------
Not all law may be clear so case law is the judges interpretation of a law.


Statute Law
-----------

Statue law is laid down by Acts of Parliament, often referred to as **legislaton**.

Secondary Legislation
---------------------

An act of parliament often given the government power to introduce regulations (*statutory 
instruments*) that are laid before Parliament but are debated only if a member specifically calls 
for a debate.

###Examples:

* Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997
* Companies (Single Person Private Limited Companies) Regulations 1992
* Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981


European Union Law
------------------

The EU issues directives, approved by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Member states are then required to enact legislation to give effect to these directives.

The European Count of Justice handles cases where the interpretation or implementation of directives is in question.

Data protection act was an EU act.


Legal Systems in Other Countries
--------------------------------

Distinction between civil and criminal law is universal. Common law largely restricted to countries that have been ruled by Britain. European countries other than the UK have a system based on Roman law.

Most large countries have bicameral legislatures, small ones usually have unicameral ones.

In some countries the second chamber has a revising function only while in others (e.g. the USA) it can also initiate legislation.

Federal states duplicate the legislative structure at the level of the individual state. There is often tension between state law and federal law.


Constitutions
-------------


Most countries (not the UK) have constitutions:

* How the country is governed
* The rights of the citizens
* ???

In countries with a written constitution there is a Supreme count which can strike out a legislation that is contrary to the constitution.

In the UK, the doctrine of the *sovereignty of Parliament*, means that if Parliament passes legislation, the courts cannot block it.
