* Indirect is the imposing of a requirement which can be satisfied by a much smaller proportion of a group than from another which cannot be justifiable by the job requirements.

###Question 4
This question is about employee retention and professional status.

####Question 4.a)
Systems Designers PLC, a major UK software and service company with more than 1,000 employees, carried out an employee survey five years ago to help find out why employees were leaving at twice the rate of the industry average. Subsequent exit interviews suggested that poor pay rates were the cause of the high employee turnover. The company increased its pay rates, but the high turnover rate failed to decline. 

The company undertook a deeper investigation of employee turnover patterns over the last twelve months and found several factors were involved. The investigation also found that pay levels had the weakest impact on employee turnover.

Based on the above scenario that demonstrates the fallibility of exit interviews, discuss THREE factors you think would have more influence on employee turnover and explain why.

---

* Job satisfaction (training from professional bodies and development)
* Market forces (?)
* Discontent
* Politics and office conditions
* Job design

* Honesty of exit interviews

####Question 4.b)

###Question 5
This question is on the subject of employment law.

Joan Doe was employed by a local pub as a barmaid on a six month contract. As part of her duties she had to ensure that all the glasses were washed and the bar tidied up ready for the cleaners in the morning. The pub had a kitchen and this was the final exit route that Joan had to take at night. Two stairs led down from the bar into the kitchen. One night when Joan was the last one leaving she noticed that the kitchen light had been switched off by the back door â€“ on the other side of kitchen. On stepping down the stairs she fell in the dark and broke her collarbone.

Her employer didn't renew her contract.

####Question 5.a)
From what you have read, discuss Joan's employer's responsibility in this accident.

---

System should be in place to ensure this never happens. H&S procedure needs to be reviewed, incident book. Joan needs to report dangerous situations.

####Question 5.b)
Discuss the issues that Joan might have in relation to bringing a case against her employer for unfair dismissal.

---

Disability discrimination? Perfectly within their rights to not renew the contract.
