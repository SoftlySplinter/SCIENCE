Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
===================================
Ways for big corporations to get stinking rich.

Types of Rights
---------------
* Copyright
* Patents
* Confidential Information
* Trademarks
* Design Rights
* Moral Rights


Copyright
---------
Protects:

* Original works (literary, dramatic, musical and artistic).
* Sound recordings, films, broadcasts and cable transmissions.
* The typographic arrangement of published editions.

Any protected item is known as a "work".

### Software Copyright
The 1988 Copyright, Patents and Design Act states that the phrase "literary work" includes a table
or compilation, a computer program and preparatory design materials for a computer program.

An EU directive makes a similar clause.

### Copyright Holder Rights
Copyright holders get five exclusive rights:

1. The right to copy the work.
2. The right to issue copies to the public.
3. The right to perform, play or show the work to the public.
4. The right to broadcast the work or transmit it to a cable service.
5. The right to make an adaption of the work.

These rights last different lengths depending on the country - 70 years since the death of the 
author in the EU and USA (post-2002 for the latter). Pre-2002 USA copyright can last up to 95 
years in some cases.

50 years since the death of the author in Canada.

### Database Rights

If a database is the author's "own original intellectual creation", it is treated as a literary
work. If there has been "substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents
of the database", then it is also protected by the database right (which lasts 15 years less than
full copyright).

### Who Owns Copyright?
Copyright is owned by the author(s), unless the author is an employee and the work is created 
within the course of employment, then the copyright is held by the employer. An independent 
contractor does not count as an employee unless stated otherwise.

Copyright may only be transferred in writing.

Copyright is implied.

### Infringement

Anyone who, without consent, does any of the five things that are exclusive right of the owner 
of the copyright has committed *primary infringement*.

Anyone who does this knowingly has committed *secondary infringement*.

Primary infringement is purely a civil matter, secondary infringement can be a criminal matter.

### Registering Copyright
In the EU, full copyright protection comes into affect when the work is 'fixed' (i.e. recorded in
some form).

In the USA protection is very limited until the copyright has been registered with the US Congress
Office.

### What counts as a copy?
Copyright is breached by copying 'the whole or a substantial part of the work', substantial 
doesn't necessarily mean a large part, just a key part.

Non-literal copying (e.g. using the same design to produce a similar system in a different 
language) also counts as breaching copyright.


### Licensing
A license allows someone (the *licensee*) to use a work for some or all purposes but the owner 
retains ownership. These licenses can be *exclusive* or *non-exclusive*, for a fixed period or be
*in perpetuity*.

In an assignment, the copyright owner transfers some or all rights of ownership to someone else 
(the *assignee*).

### What is allowed?
* Fair dealing, copying for:
    * Private study or research.
    * Criticism or review.
    * Reporting current events.
* Marking a back-up copy.
* Selling on.
* Decompilation for interoperability.
* Error correction.

### Enforcing Copyright
* Search and seizure.
* Injunction.
* Damages.
* Claim for profits.

Powerful copyright owners often prevent legal publication of copies by threatening action the 
publisher cannot afford to defend.


Patents
-------

Patents give an inventor the exclusive right to use or exploit their invention (or sell it) for 
up to 20 years.

The invention must be:

* New;
* Novel (involve an inventive step);
* Capable of industrial application;
* Not specifically excluded.

All patents are published and are publicly available.

### Specific Exclusions
* Scientific Theories;
* Mathematical Theories;
* Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;
* Presentation or information;
* Schemes, rules, or methods for performing a mental act, playing a game or doing business; or a 
program for a computer.

### Patent Owners
Patents are only granted to inventors or subsequent assignees.

Employees are treated as inventors unless the invention is made in the course of their normal 
duties, in which case the inventor is the company (special rules for senior management).

### Getting a Patent
It is essential to establish a *priority* when applying for a patent. There is a need to apply 
early, even if the invention isn't perfect.

### Software Patents
European Patent Convention states that software isn't patentable.

Software is patentable in the USA and have been enforced in sensible situations.


Confidential Information
------------------------

Information cannot be 'stolen', information can be prevented from being disclosed or used provided
an *obligation of confidence* exists, this comes through a contract or through equity (fairness or
common law).

In some cases, public interest can override the obligation of confidence.


Trademark Protection
--------------------

Includes trademarks (logos, etc.), trade names or "get-up" (a uniform or similar).

There are international agreements between most companies which oblige them to enact domestic laws
that fulfil the requirements of the agreement.

A trademark must be registered in each company in which protection is desired.

It is a criminal offence to use an unauthorised copyright commercially.


Domain Names
------------

Originally meant as a simple way of connection over the internet but is now regarded as a 
marketing term. Domain names are assigned by ICANN.

Domain names can conflict with trademarks.
