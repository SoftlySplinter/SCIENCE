#Employment Law

Three main areas:

1. Anti-discrimination,
2. Trade Unions,
3. Welfare of individual employees.


##Discrimination

Characteristics:

* Age
* Disability
* Gender identity
* Marriage or Civil Partnership
* Pregnancy or maternity
* Race
* Religion or belief
* Sex
* Sexual Orientation

###Direct Discrimination
Treating one person less favourably than another purely on the grounds of any characteristic listed above.

###Indirect Discrimination
Imposing a requirement that:

* Can be satisfied by a much small proportion of people from one group of a characteristic than from another;
* Cannot be shown to be justifiable by the needs of the job.

###Discrimination on the grounds of disability
Treating a disabled person less favourably without justification and failing to make a reasonable adjustment without justification.

###Enforcement
Court action can only be initiated by the Equal Opportunities Commission (sex discrimination), the Commission for Racial Equality (racial discrimination) or the Disability Rights Commission, except that, individuals may take allegations of discrimination relating to employment directly to an Employment Tribunal.

###Industrial Tribunals/Labour Courts
Set up to handle cases of unfair dismissal and discrimination in employment matters brought by individuals. They are cheaper and simpler than civil courts, but legal or trade union representation is desirable.

Limited powers, but can award compensation and order reinstatement.

Appeals are rare but possible, although not often successful.

##Trade Unions
> "An organisation of workers created to protect and advance the interests of its members by negotiating agreements with employers on pay and conditions of work. Unions may also provide legal advice, financial assistance, sickness benefits and sickness facilities" - ACAS

A Trade Union is recognised by an employer when it negotiates agreements with an employer on pay and other employment contracts on behalf of the body of workers (the **bargaining unit**). This is called **collective bargaining**.

Recognition can be the result of voluntary agreement between the employer or union or it can be statutory (enforced by law).

###Labour Relations (pre-1980)
Collective bargaining and agreements were not legally enforceable. Many strikes were called, often unofficial, and against the wishes of the workers.

Violent picketing and secondary action (the support strike of workers in a secondary, separate, enterprise). Management found they couldn't make decisions and execute procedures because if union officials didn't agree the managers were afraid that there would be a strike.

###Trade Unions (pre-1980)
Unions were immune to actions for tort and breaches of contract in relation to "trade disputes".

Used a **closed shop** policy, where employers agree to hire union members only, and employees must remain union members at all times to retain employment.

Problem of multiple unions and differentials.

Unions were driven by a small number of anarchists.

Political levy.

###Employment Act (1980)
Secondary action made illegal.

Pickets could only picket their place of employment.

Unions encouraged to ballot their members before taking strike action.

###Employment Act (1982)
Redefined "trade dispute" to be a dispute between workers and their employer relating "wholly or mainly to terms of employment".

Union legal immunity removed when they authorised unlawful industrial action.

Improved rights for workers in closed shop policies.

###Employment Act (1984)
Ballot of members before strike action made mandatory, or legal immunity removed.

###Employment Acts (1988-1990)
Improving edge cases:

* Procedural changes for ballots
* Unlawful to discriminate on grounds of membership or non-membership of a union (removing closed shop policies)
* Union liable for damages arising from unofficial action unless explicitly repudiated.
* Selective dismissal of strikers permitted.

###Trade Union and Labour Regulations (Consolidated) Act (1992)
Replaced all previous legislation and consolidates it into a single act.

###Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)
Founded in 1896 (present name and structure date from 1974) to prevent and resolve problems within the workplace, through conciliation, mediation and arbitration services.

##Individual Employment Rights

* Unfair dismissal
* Contracts of employment
* Discriminations rights
* Maintenance of rights when transferred
* Right to join a union of choice (including no union)
* Limits on hours
* Statutory sick pay
* "Family friendly" rights

###Trade Union Reform and Employment Relations Act (1993)
Gives employees the right to join a union of their choice, permission required to deduct union subscription at source.

Extends the circumstances in which unfair dismissal can be claimed and extends maternity provisions.

###Employment Relations Act (1999)
Equality of treatment of part-time workers.

Parental leave and "family friendly" policies.

Increased protection against unfair dismissal.

Abolished the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members and the Commissioner for Protection Against Unlawful Industrial Action.

###Employment Relations Act (2003)
Parental and adoption leave.

Dispute resolution.

Improved industrial tribunal procedures.

Equal pay questionnaires.

###Dismissal
Grounds for fair dismissal:

* Conduct
* Capability
* Redundancy
* Statutory requirement
* *Any other reason*

But employer must follow correct procedures (**due process**).

Unfair dismissal is:

* When the employer fails to follow the due process
* Dismissal for any reason excluded by anti-discrimination legislation
* Dismissal for taking part in trade union activities
* Dismissal for taking action against an employer to enforce employment rights
* Dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy
* Dismissal for refusal to do shop or betting work on a Sunday
* Dismissal for *not* being a member of a trade union
* and many more...

###Redundancy
Dismissals because of redundancy occur when an employer no longer needs people to do their jobs. In most cases employees will be entitled to compensation based on their age, salary and years of service. The law lays down the minimum level of compensation, but it is typical for employers to pay more than this.

If the employer is intending to make 20 or more employees redundant over a period of 90 or less, the employees (or their representatives) have a right to be consulted.

There are two definitions of redundancy in British law. For the purposes of entitlement to compensation, redundancy occurs when an employee is dismissed because the employer no longer needs employees to do that job in that place.

In determining the right to consultation, however, redundancy is defined as occurring when the dismissal for a reason or reasons not relating to the individual employee.

It is common practise to use a stack based system when making employees redundant (LIFO), this is acceptable to unions and courts.

Dismissal for redundancy can easily become unfair dismissal if individuals are selected for redundancy in some other way (as with anything else).

####Constructive Dismissal
A fundamental breach, by the employer, of an employee's contract of employment, which effectively indicates that the employer no longer intends to be bound by it.

The employee can have recourse to an industrial tribunal as if an actual dismissal had taken place.

###Public Interest Disclosure Action (1998)
Protects employees who:

* Make disclosures about malpractice to their managers or bodies such as the HSE or the FSA provided the employee has reasonable grounds for the disclosure and it is made in good faith.
* Make disclosures about malpractice more widely (e.g. to the police, the press or an M.P.) provided it was not done for personal gain and
    * Reasonably believed they would have been victimised if it was raised internally or with a regulator, *or*
    * Reasonably believed there would be a cover-up if they raised it internally and there was no regulator, *or*
    * Had already been raised internally or with a regulator and nothing had been done.

###Wrongful Dismissal
Wrongful dismissal is significantly different from unfair dismissal, an action for wrongful dismissal is an action for damages brought by an employee against an employer for breach of the contract of employment. It is an action under the common law and for this reason is not subject to the maxima laid down by statue for unfair dismissal.

Typically brought by very senior or highly paid employees who can make a reasonable case for compensation resulting from their employer's breaking of contract.

###Contracts of Employment
Employment brings a legal contract into existence, whether it be in writing or not. Employers must provide employees with a written statement of the main terms of the employment.

Good practise is to provide a full written contract, signed by both employer and employee.

**Express terms** are explicit in the contract. **Implied terms** that a court will regard as always existing are those which may arise from:

* Statue
* Common law
* Custom and practise of the industry

Implied terms, as the name suggests, may not be explicitly stated.
