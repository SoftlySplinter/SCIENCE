Company Finance
===============

Costs and Prices
----------------

Costs are the cost to build and make a product.

Price is the cost to your customer.


Costs
-----

Purchase costs include things like raw materials and equipment.

Costs of finance includes interest on debts, etc.

Cost of labour.

Overhead costs.

You might make money from an item, but you still make a loss on that item.

Fixed and Variable costs.

Staff costs: junior staff have around 220 chargeable days, senior staff have around 160 chargeable days (260 max).

Overhead costs not attributable to a given project.


Depreciation
------------

Most things depreciate in value. You need to know the value of equipment and stock, but sometimes it's too costly to revalue each item. Although you make profits/sales due to having an item, the actual item itself depreciates and is a cost to the business.

$$ profit = sales - costs $$

When you pay tax you want to reduce the amount of money going to the tax people and they allow you to take the depreciation of all your items from your profits.

Straight line depreciation means the item depreciates the same amount each year.

Reducing balance depreciation means the item depreciates by a percentage each year.


Pricing in the Computing Industry
---------------------------------

###Cost Plus - Project Work

Agree with client your costs per day, usually on direct labour (overhead).

Agree profit margin.

"Body shopping"

Unsuitable today for projects but used to supply skills/experience to customer projects.


###Fixed Price - Project Work

Total of: direct labour, brought in items and "indirects".

Profits added onto costs.

Used in competitive tendering (the higher the risk, the higher the profit). Risks versus profits.

####How this tends to work:
Engineers are graded (normally by salary). Company will work out an average salary per grade. Add in overheads and arrive at a daily charge.

When it comes to costing up a product, number of people; at what grade times by the daily rate for the estimate of the product length to come to a total amount of labour charges.

When you have a labour cost, you add the hardware (plus a markup on this hardware), then add a contingency. This is the big problem with fixed price work. This should be as high as you can make it. Finally add profit, simmer and serve.

Sometimes pricing is about losing business, but about being seen.

> *"Don't be afraid to add a markup."* Sage advice from Rhys Parry, February 2013


Software Product Pricing
------------------------

Marginal costs very low (manual, box, CD, etc.)

Large development costs.

Amortised over time.

Sales proportional to marketing.

Sales fall with increasing price.

> *"I must go on a diet"* - Rhys Parry after turning on some lights with his bulk, February 2013,


Customer Expectations
---------------------

Price		Nature
--------	------------------------------------------------
Free		Shareware
£20     	Buyers Risk - Internet Sales
£100-500	High volume - Real software - Office suits, etc.
£10,000		Real product - low volume - Bugs and Support
£1000,000	On the drawing board (or an IBM product)


Support and other Issues
------------------------

Large percentage of income (10-25% of turnover).


Cash Flow
---------

Gets confused with profits.

Bringing in a concept called *credit*. Business to business (B2B) relationships.

Most companies allow you credit. Upon invoice normally you have 30 days in credit.

Credit orders and invoices are the norm for B2B transactions.


Payment Cycle
-------------

Send invoice at the end of the Month

Receive money 1-2 months later

Therefore up to 3 months salaries, rents, bills to pay, etc.

Problem is you need cash as a start-up.

Big companies are generally the worst for paying in time.

> *"Oh it's a long walk here."* - Rhys going from one side of Hugh Owen C4 to the other.

Cash in and cash out are not the same as sales, costs and profits.


Types of Software House
-----------------------

Body Shopping Services - need a few months working capital.

Product Developer - Needs perhaps a year or more development funds.

Bespoke Software - Could use advanced from customer to help cash flow.


Getting the Money
-----------------

(*A: tl;dr "Give us your fucking money."*).

Business plan:

* Description of Business
* Technical feasibility
* Founders expertise
* Market size
* Competition
* Financial prediction

More later.


Sources of Funds
----------------

* Loans
* Equity
* Grants


###Grants

Money *given* to a company. May have restrictions on various things.


###Loans

Money *lent* to a company. Interest payable on it, personal guarantees on the loan.

Secured loan has some assurance that you have enough collateral. Unsecured they don't.

Personal loans from friends.

Soft leans, short/long term, overdraft, etc.


###Equity

Money *paid* to the company for a *share* of that company.

Risk versus reward.

Dragons Den. I'm out.


Balance Sheets
--------------

Time for motherfucking spreadsheets (in space).

Snapshot on a particular date.

How much are you worth?

* Assets, fixed and liquid (current).

How much do you owe?

* Tax
* VAT
* Creditors
* Bank Loans
* Shareholders

$$ Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders\text{ }Equity $$

###P/L Cost Overheads

* Wages
* NI
* Rent
* Rates - Business and Water
* Gas and Electricity
* Telephone, ISP
* Postage, Printing, Stationary
* Advertising
* Insurance
* Repairs and Maintenance
* Interest Payments
* Bank charges
* Depreciation
* Travel
* Legal
* Subscriptions and Periodicals

###Capital Equipment

Capital Equipment does not appear in the P/L, it is taken from the cashflow and the depreciation is treated as a cost in the P/L.


###Rhys' Tip for the Assignment (of the week)

Projected profile/loss worked out every month. Cashflow on a monthly basis. Balance sheet at the end of the year.


###Example Startup

Shareholders raise: £50,000

Cash goes in the bank.

After trading for a while:

Sales: £10,000 (invoiced)

VAT: £1,750

Purchases: £2,000

Assets               Liabilities and Shareholders
---------            ----------------------------
Receivables £11,750  ...
Cash on hand $48,000 ...
Computers £2,000     ...
Total £61,750        ...

Receivables are things that haven't been paid, but have been invoiced/similar.


Remember this shit
------------------

Try this by purchasing items on credit to create liabilities, you put how much you owe on the liabilities side and the new item into your assets (this balances).

When you pay it off you lose the liability on one side and the cash from your asset side.

Reduce the profit (shareholders equity) by the depreciate to date, balances with loss of same amount on the assets side of the equation.

Balances sheets **balance**.

Balance sheets run vertically.
