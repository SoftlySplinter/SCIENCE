Diagnostic Fault Tree
=====================

Diagnosis is where you determine the cause and effect of problem.

Wide applications of diagnosis from medical to network troubleshooting. Diagnostic systems and devices are designed by humans.

One of the most successful applications of knowledge-based systems.

Techniques:

* Apply logic
* Analysis
* Experience
* etc.


Car Diagnosis
-------------

Customer provides technician with the details of the problem. The technician looks at the car (manual intervention). Probe readings are passed into a diagnostic computer which provides guidance to the technician.


Effective Diagnostic System
---------------------------

* Efficient Construction
* Reasonable maintainability
* Adequate coverage
* Correct answer
* Minimum effort from user
* Appropriate response time
* Good cost to benefit ration.


Diagnostic Tree
---------------

A tree structure where the nodes are questions and responses and edges are answers to the questions (*Author: A flowchart effectively*).

Allows a normal tree-search.

CLIPS and Jess can be used to build diagnostic systems or they can be programmed manually.


Thinking
--------

How do you get the knowledge for troubleshooting?
