#Extreme Programming (or XP for short)

Extreme Programming (XP) is a practice invented by Kant Beck* of Chrysler Corp.
Beck identified weaknesses in existing waterfall models for software
development and decided to create XP as a better system in large software
development teams. 

*Sidenote: Beck also invented JUnit*

##Rationale

Beck decided that people were drawing too many parallels between Software
Engineering and Physical Engineering and this was slowing things down:a

* Software is much more malleable than physics
* There are fewer costs involved with changing things later on (in construction
  you might have already purchased the materials for your bridge)
* With software it's a lot harder to get a full and accurate list of system
  specs and these specs might change.

XP aims to make the cost of change lower through better communication between
the team and the customer

##Planning Game

##Pair Programming

XP has three distinct planning games:

    * Initial Planning - before the project has started
    * Release Planning - done throughout in order to determine when the next
      stable release should be shipped
    * Iteration planning - done each 'iteration' to determine what work needs
      to be done before the next one.
